	ALIZE is a development project initiated by the ELISA consortium
	[alize.univ-avignon.fr/] and funded by the French Research 
	Ministry in the framework of the TECHNOLANGUE program 
	[www.technolangue.net]

	The ALIZE project team wants to highlight the limits of voice
	authentication in a forensic context.
	The "Person  Authentification by Voice: A Need of Caution" paper 
	proposes a good overview of this point (cf. "Person  
	Authentification by Voice: A Need of Caution", Bonastre J.F., 
	Bimbot F., Boe L.J., Campbell J.P., Douglas D.A., Magrin-
	chagnolleau I., Eurospeech 2003, Genova].
	The conclusion of the paper of the paper is proposed bellow:
	[Currently, it is not possible to completely determine whether the 
	similarity between two recordings is due to the speaker or to other 
	factors, especially when: (a) the speaker does not cooperate, (b) there 
	is no control over recording equipment, (c) recording conditions are not 
	known, (d) one does not know whether the voice was disguised and, to a 
	lesser extent, (e) the linguistic content of the message is not 
	controlled. Caution and judgment must be exercised when applying speaker 
	recognition techniques, whether human or automatic, to account for these 
	uncontrolled factors. Under more constrained or calibrated situations, 
	or as an aid for investigative purposes, judicious application of these 
	techniques may be suitable, provided they are not considered as infallible.
	At the present time, there is no scientific process that enables one to 
	uniquely characterize a person=92s voice or to identify with absolute 
	certainty an individual from his or her voice.]

  /*!
  This class represents a features server.\n
  A featureServer is a circular buffer that can store features. Each feature
  can be accessed using an index or in a sequential way like a file.
  A feature server can read feature from a FeatureInputStream derived
  object. A feature server is itself derived from the FeatureInputStream
  class. It is possible to connect a feature server to an other one.
  When you create a feature server with a FeatureInputStream object, the
  server will read features from this object and store them until the object
  returns a NULL pointer. If the buffer size exceed the number of features
  loaded, the superfluous features are set to invalid.
  If you create a feature server without FeatureInputStream object connected,
  all the features are invalid.
